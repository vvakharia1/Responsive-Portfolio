    <p> <strong>Hi! I'm Vidhi and welcome to my first self-built web page!</strong>
    <br/>
    Born and raised for a few years in India, I came in to New York with my parents
    at the age of 3 years old and fell in love with the city from the beginning. Throughout my life, I've lived mostly in the Tri-State area and
    being around such a diversified community at all times played a huge part in my passion for traveling. 
    <br/>
    As I build upon my portfolio, majority of the content will be dedicated to my travels and the stories of the people I have had the 
    pleasure of meeting and sharing tales with. I hope you love viewing my pictures and reading the stories as much as I have loved experiencing them.
